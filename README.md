# Everything Viewer

Okay, not *everything*. The idea is to support different formats and maybe provide some additional information or tools.


## Supported formats

* Audio – *if the browser supports the format*
* CSV
* EML
	* Show the email headers
	* Show the email body with external resources removed
* Image – *if the browser supports the format*
* PDF – *if the browser supports it*
* Text
	* With syntax highlighting for selected languages
* Video – *if the browser supports the format*


## Libraries

* CSV – https://github.com/vanillaes/csv
* highlight.js – https://highlightjs.org/
* JSZip – https://github.com/Stuk/jszip
