# Everything Viewer

Okay, not *everything*. The idea is to support different formats and maybe provide some additional information or tools.


## Supported formats

* Audio – *if the browser supports the format*
* CSV
* EML
	* Show the email headers
	* Show the email body with external resources removed
* iCal
* Image – *if the browser supports the format*
	* GIF: Step through each frame
* PDF – *if the browser supports it*
* Text
	* With syntax highlighting for selected languages
* VCF (vCard)
* Video – *if the browser supports the format*
* ZIP
	* Show a list of the directory structure and files
